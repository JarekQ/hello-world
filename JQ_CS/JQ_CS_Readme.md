# JQ C-Sharp Code

This folder organizes all C-Sharp code created for presentation.

It is composed of some Art, Working, and In-Development code.

Note to self, for every new CS file created; please put in this subdirectory instead of just root.

# JQ Soul Code

JarekQ's 'Soul Code' was an art idea I had in January 2019 when starting my first job at InComm Payments.

It was a means of inspiration to build/grow from and help offset my internal affects of "Imposter Syndrome".

After completing these first 2 pieces of code art, I had them printed in color and thumbtacked to my cubicle.

Now in 2022 with WFH, I hope to revisit this art collection and build on it to adapt to today.

# JQ Working Code

In summary, this is code that can and should work when the necessary libraries are installed so the compiler can execute them.

At this time (2022), very basic and low functioning.

I plan to add my old code from school to add to my GitHub for public presentation to show how far I have come in learning.

# JQ In-Development Code

Isn't all code in development? Yes.

Is there a finite end to development? Yes.

Are there ways to further extend finite code that has been developed? Always.

These propositional statements illustrate that progress is never ending.
