# hello-world
test GitHub repository

I am a student at Kennesaw State University.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I've been developing software for 7 years.

From n00b as a senior in High School (2011) to about to graduate college (2018).

From MIT's Scratch, BASIC, & HTML to C# and C++!
