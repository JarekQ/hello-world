# hello-world
test GitHub repository

I am a student at Kennesaw State University.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I've been developing software for 7 years.

From n00b as a senior in High School (2011) to about to graduate college (2018).

From MIT's Scratch, BASIC, & HTML to C# and C++!

# Revisited as Software Engineer
Since working at InComm Payments for 2+ years (Jan. 2019 - Today), I have created another GitHub repo that is private.

I did it because I respect their code base and database naming schemas; I also wanted to share with my fellow employees my coding abilities.

I know how to program and create software, I have experience; I am selective and conservative on what I share on the web.

Code creations added to this repository will continue to be code creations in raw form to enhance my portfolio.

To add to the rolling figure of "experience" I have been developing AND supporting code development as of now: 9+ years!!!
