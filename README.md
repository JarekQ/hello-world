# hello-world
test GitHub repository

I am a student at Kennesaw State University.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I've been developing software for 7 years.

From n00b as a senior in High School (2011/2012) to about to graduate college (December 2018).

From MIT's Scratch, BASIC, & HTML to C# and C++!

# Revisited as Software Engineer
Since working at InComm Payments for 2+ years (Jan. 2019 - Today), I have created another GitHub repo that is private.

I did it because I respect their code base and database naming schemas; I also wanted to share with my fellow employees my coding abilities.

I know how to program and create software, I have experience; I am selective and conservative on what I share on the web.

Code creations added to this repository will continue to be code creations in raw form to enhance my portfolio.

To add to the rolling figure of "experience" I have been developing AND supporting code development as of now: 9+ years!!!

# Hello 2023 World
Continuing to learn new things.

Right now, I am learning Golang still from November/December 2022; it is a language used in Cryptocurrency & Blockchain.

I am building my first company to show proof of work in Software Development.

Learning to code on the job is not working... I have to learn it more for myself.

I need to create things I am proud of for me, regardless who else likes it or not.

That is progress in thy self; not stagnation through awaiting approval from someone else.
