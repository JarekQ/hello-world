# JQ GO Code

This folder organizes all GO code created for presentation.

Note to self, for every new GO file created; please put in this subdirectory instead of just root.

# JQ Pluralsight Code

When I use Pluralsight to learn new things, I follow along with tutorials from other coders by copy/pasting their code.

While not necessarily coding from scratch, it helps me visualize and step through what the presenters are teaching for code comprehension.

I do cite their work and state I did not create it.

Dr. Fowler, my game development professor, would say, "Give credit where credit is due."

Ideally, if I did some labs; I can and should put them here as well.
